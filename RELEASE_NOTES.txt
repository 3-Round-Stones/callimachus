= REQUIREMENTS FOR CALLIMACHUS 1.1 (Open Source) =

Callimachus works best on browsers that are closely tracking the development
of HTML5.  At the time of this writing, Callimachus works best on Chrome and
Firefox.  It is recommended that Callimachus users track updates to their
browsers for the best usage experience.

Chrome 25 has been thoroughly tested.
Firefox 20 has no known issues.
Safari 6.1 has known issues.
Internet Explorer 9 and 10 cannot edit textual documents.

Details of browser support may be found at:
  http://callimachusproject.org/docs/1.1/articles/browser-support.docbook?view

The Callimachus server requires Java JDK 7 on the server to run.

SEVERE: Error processing http://callimachusproject.org/callimachus/1.0/types/GraphDocument
SEVERE: Error processing http://callimachusproject.org/callimachus/1.0/types/NamedGraph

In some environments, Callimachus may log "An exception has occurred in the
compiler...FilePermission" exceptions. This is often due to an issue in the
embedded Java compiler and if so has no impact on the run time behaviour of
Callimachus.
