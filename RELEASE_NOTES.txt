= REQUIREMENTS FOR CALLIMACHUS 1.1.2 (Open Source) =

Callimachus works best on browsers that are closely tracking the development
of HTML5.  At the time of this writing, Callimachus works best on Chrome and
Firefox.  It is recommended that Callimachus users track updates to their
browsers for the best usage experience.

Chrome 25 has been thoroughly tested.
Firefox 20 has no known issues.
Safari 6.1 has known issues.
Internet Explorer 9 and 10 cannot edit textual documents.

Details of browser support may be found at:
  http://callimachusproject.org/docs/1.1/articles/browser-support.docbook?view

In some environments, Callimachus may log "An exception has occurred in the
compiler...FilePermission" exceptions. This is often due to an issue in the
embedded Java compiler and if so has no impact on the run time behaviour of
Callimachus.

= HOWTO UPGRADE FROM 1.0.1, 1.1, and 1.1.1 =

Stop the server using the callimachus-stop script in the bin directory.
Remove the lib, bin, tmp, src directories.

Download and unzip the callimachus-1.1.2.zip file in the install directory of
the Callimachus instance to be upgraded. Run the bin/callimachus-setup script to
upgrade the repositories directory. Use the "-K" flag to disabled automatic
backup.
