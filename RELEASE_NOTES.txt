Callimachus Project Release Notes

= REQUIREMENTS OF 0.16 =

Callimachus works best on browsers that are closely tracking the
development of HTML5.  At the time of this writing, Callimachus
works best on Chrome, with Firefox and Safari as second choices.  It is
recommended that Callimachus users track updates to their browsers for
the best usage experience.

Chrome 17 has been thoroughly tested.
Firefox 10 and Safari 5 have no known issues.
Internet Explorer 8 and 9 can login and read content, use the
edit form, but cannot edit text documents or create complex resources.
However, IE 9 with Chrome Frame should act like Chrome.

The Callimachus server requires Java JDK 1.6.0_18+ (before 1.7) on the
server to run.

= NEW IN VERSION 0.16 =

Callimachus 0.16 has a new graphical installer that is the primary way to
install *and configure* Callimachus.  The installer may be re-run any time
you need to change your Callimachus configuration.  You may also re-run the
installer to change the password for the initial user.

Callimachus may now serve multiple HTTP/HTTPS authorities (like Apache
virtual hosts).  Multiple authorities are configured using the installer.

Named queries in Callimachus may now include parameters to facilitate their
reuse.  For example, a simple SPARQL SELECT query may now be created once
and used with different parameters, like this:
[[
SELECT * { <$param> ?p ?o }
]]

Text searches in Callimachus, search various RDF labels.  As of 0.16, text
searches apply to all labels if the "Serve all RDF resources" option is
enabled during installation.  That option is selected by default.  If that
option is turned off, searches only apply to labels associated with the
HTTP authority you accessed Callimachus on, unless it is the primary authority,
in which case secondary authorities are also searched.

= KNOWN ISSUES IN 0.16 =

 * Empty table cells are omitted in from template.
 * Language tags are not supported with forms.
 * All possible options in check boxes must have a label.
 * Trailing whitespace in @typeof attribute is not supported.
 * Safari browser cannot view Turtle or RDF/XML output in describe tab.
 * rdf:XMLLiteral on form create auto adds xmlns to elements.
 * Blank nodes in INSERT clause are not supported
 * literals with language tags will not match in keyword search

= HOWTO UPGRADE FROM 0.15 =

All information saved through a Web browser is saved in the repositories
directory. This directory should be backed up (in the stopped state) before
attempting to upgrade.

All files and folders in the webapps/ dir (not in webapps/callimachus/) must
be removed while the 0.15 server is running. Folders can be compressed to a ZIP
file and imported into a newly created (empty) folder using the Web interface.
Files can be dragged or uploaded to the home folder.

Stop the 0.15 server using the callimachus-stop script in the bin directory.
Remove the lib, bin, tmp, webapps directories. Backup any configuration files
in etc, including etc/callimachus.conf.

Download and run the Callimachus-Setup-0.16.exe or (.run) installer (see
README.txt for details). Choose the same install path and provide your
configuration settings to complete the upgrade.
