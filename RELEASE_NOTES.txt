Callimachus Project Release Notes

= REQUIREMENTS OF 0.16 =

Callimachus works best on browsers that are closely tracking the
development of HTML5.  At the time of this writing, Callimachus
works best on Chrome, with Firefox and Safari as second choices.  It is
recommended that Callimachus users track updates to their browsers for
the best usage experience.

Chrome 17 has been thoroughly tested.
Firefox 10+ and Safari 5 have no known issues.
Internet Explorer 8 and 9 can login and read content, use the
edit form, but cannot edit text documents or create complex resources.
However, IE 9 with Chrome Frame should act like Chrome.

The Callimachus server requires Java JDK 1.6.0_20+ (not 1.7) (server-side)
to run.

= NEW IN VERSION 0.16 =

Callimachus 0.16 has a new graphical installer that is the primary way to
install *and configure* Callimachus.  The installer may be re-run any time
you need to change your Callimachus configuration.  You may also re-run the
installer to change the password for the initial user.

Execute the installer by running its JAR file:
[[
$ java -jar callimachus-setup-<version>.jar
]]

The installer may also be run in console mode for headless installations
on Linux servers.  Please see README.txt for details.

Callimachus may now serve multiple HTTP/HTTPS authorities (like Apache
virtual hosts).  Multiple authorities are configured using the installer.

Named queries in Callimachus may now include parameters to facilitate their
reuse.  For example, a simple SPARQL DESCRIBE query may now be created once
and used with different parameters, like this:
[[
DESCRIBE <$param>
]]

Text searches in Callimachus search various RDF labels.  As of 0.16, text
searches apply to all labels if the "Serve all RDF resources" option is
enabled during installation.  That option is selected by default.  If that
option is turned off, searches only apply to labels associated with the
HTTP authority you accessed Callimachus on.

= NEW IN VERSION 0.15 =

Callimachus 0.15 support SPARQL 1.1 update statements, supports user created 
themes, and includes support for blank nodes. Include the attribute @typeof in 
XHTML+RDFa markup templates to indicate the start of a new blank node. WOFF 
files are now supported. Multiple manifests and multiple themes can now be used
by different templates.

= KNOWN ISSUES IN 0.15 =

 * Error messages are not shown when using Ctrl-S within an text edit form. Use 
   the save button to see the error message.
 * Empty table cell are omitted in from template.
 * Language tags are not supported with forums.
 * All possible options in check boxes must have a label.
 * Trailing whitespace in @typeof attribute is not supported.
 * Safari browser cannot view Turtle or RDF/XML output in describe tab.
 * The user can only created new resources in the same authority.
 * rdf:XMLLiteral on form create auto adds xmlns to elements.
 * Blank nodes in INSERT clause are not supported
 * literals with language tags will not match in keyword search

= HOWTO UPGRADE FROM 0.14 =

All information saved through a Web browser is saved in the repositories
directory. This directory should be backup (in the stopped state) before
attempting to upgrade.

Stop the 0.14 server using the callimachus-stop script in the bin directory.
Remove the lib and tmp directories. Remove the supplied callimachus.war file in
the webapps directory.
Backup any configuration files in etc, including etc/callimachus.conf. Unzip
callimachus-0.15.zip over top of the rest of your existing installation. This
will create a lib directory and webapps/callimachus.war. Restore your
configuration settings in etc/callimachus.conf. Start the server using the new
callimachus start script in the bin directory with the argument "--update".

$ callimachus-start.bat --update
-- OR --
$ sh callimachus-start.sh --update

Change all templates to use "/callimachus/template.xsl" at the top of the file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="/callimachus/template.xsl"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" ...

Change the markup used for aside boxes in the templates as follows.

Place all aside boxes in a single <div id="sidebar" />. Use the element type
<aside/> for each box. Include an <h3/> element as a label heading for each box,
if appropriate. Include one or more block elements, such as <p/>, <ul/>, <dl/>, 
or <table/>, within each <aside/> element.

Change <label class="input"/> to use the CSS class "radio" or "checkbox" instead.

Use CSS to override the logo image of a theme in the manifest.

Use calli namespace for HTTP annotations in server side request handlers. See 
http://callimachusproject.org/rdf/2009/framework a list of calli annotations.
