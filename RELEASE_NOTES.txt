= HOWTO UPGRADE FROM 0.14 =

All information saved through a Web browser is saved in the repositories
directory. This directory should be backup (in the stopped state) before
attempting to upgrade.

Stop the 0.14 server using the callimachus-stop script in the bin directory.
Remove the lib and tmp directories. Remove the supplied callimachus.war file in
the webapps directory.
Backup any configuration files in etc, including etc/callimachus.conf. Unzip
callimachus-0.15.zip over top of the rest of your existing installation. This
will restore a lib directory and webapps/callimachus.war. Restore your
configuration settings in etc/callimachus.conf. Start the server using the new
callimachus start script in the bin directory with the argument "--update".

$ callimachus-start.bat --update
-- OR --
$ sh callimachus-start.sh --update

Change all templates to use "/callimachus/template.xsl" at the top of the file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="/callimachus/template.xsl"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" ...

Change the markup used for aside boxes in the templates as follows.

Place all aside boxes in a single <div id="sidebar" />. Use the element type
<aside/> for each box. Include an <h3/> element as a label heading for each box,
if appropriate. Include one or more block elements, such as <p/>, <ul/>, <dl/>, 
or <table/>, within each <aside/> element.

Change <label class="input"/> to use the CSS class "radio" or "checkbox" instead.

Use CSS to override the logo image of a theme in the manifest.

Use calli namespace for HTTP annotations in server side request handlers. See
