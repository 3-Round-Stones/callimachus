Callimachus Project Release Notes

= REQUIREMENTS OF 0.18 =

Callimachus works best on browsers that are closely tracking the
development of HTML5.  At the time of this writing, Callimachus
works best on Chrome, with Firefox and Safari as second choices.  It is
recommended that Callimachus users track updates to their browsers for
the best usage experience.

Chrome 20 has been thoroughly tested.
Firefox 10 and Safari 5 have no known issues.
Internet Explorer 8 and 9 can login and read content, use the
edit form, but cannot edit text documents or create complex resources.

The Callimachus server requires Java JDK 1.6.0_18+ (before 1.7) on the
server to run.

= NEW IN VERSION 0.18 =

Named Queries can now have a custom view page. Using an annotation comment both
the response Cache-Control header and the view page can be assigned on each
Named Query. In addition the view page can be a template for the resources in
the query result. Variables in the query results (one bound variable per
result/row) can be used as an anchor in the view template. This is done in a
similar way to how the variable '?this' is used in view templates. However, in a
query template there many be multiple values and the multiple variables used in
different sections of the page. The primary use case for this would be to create
a query view to list resources that match some criteria. For more information see
http://code.google.com/p/callimachus/wiki/NamedQueries

Pipelines allow complex XML transformations to be performed on the server.
Pipelines can be used to take the sparql-results of a Named Query and reformat
it into another XML or text format. The result of a pipeline can be retrived
by requsting the URL of the pipeline with '?results' appended. Pipelines are
written using the XProc XML format. More information about them can be seen here
http://code.google.com/p/callimachus/wiki/XProcExamples

To set a cache control for a pipeline (or other resource) a Copy (200) PURL can
be created pointing to the result of the pipeline. In this case the PURL will
cache the results of the pipeline. For more details about creating PURL see
http://code.google.com/p/callimachus/wiki/PURLs

Authorization can now be performed based on the DNS domain of the client. This
allows the administrator to make resources public or private simply by changing
its permissions. Three new groups have been added to simply this process. They
include "public", "everyone", and "system". The public group represents all
client agents, everyone group represents all authenticated agents, and the
system group represents all agents connecting directly from the local machine.
http://code.google.com/p/callimachus/wiki/Security has more details.

= KNOWN ISSUES IN 0.18 =

 * All possible options in check boxes must have a label.
 * Trailing whitespace in @typeof attribute causes unexpected behaviour.
 * rdf:XMLLiteral on form create auto adds xmlns to elements.
 * When resource labels are updated, referencing resource may not display new
   label until they are modified as well or the callimachus-reset script is run.
 * Safari browser cannot view Turtle or RDF/XML output in describe tab.
 * Safari does not retain the login state in all cases.
 * Safari does not support dragging files in the folder view.
 * IE does not work with the article editor.
 * The server may block on server side requests to external HTTP servers.

In some environments, Callimachus may log "An exception has occurred in the
compiler...FilePermission" exceptions. This is often due to an issue in the
embedded Java compiler and if so has no impact on the run time behaviour of
Callimachus.

= HOWTO UPGRADE FROM 0.17 =

All information saved through a Web browser is saved in the repositories
directory. This directory should be backed up (in the stopped state) before
attempting to upgrade.

Stop the 0.17 server using the callimachus-stop script in the bin directory.
Remove the lib, bin, tmp, src directories.

Download and unzip the callimachus-0.18.zip file in the install directory of
the Callimachus 0.17 instance. Run the bin/callimachus-setup.sh/.bat script to
upgrade the repositories directory. Run the bin/callimachus-start.sh/.bat script
to start Callimachus.

Every create template, that has a onsubmit="return calli.saveResourceAs(event)",
will need to be replaced with onsubmit="return calli.saveResourceAs(event,
calli.slugify($('#label').val()))" where "label" is the id of the
first input field in the form.

Every dropzone in a create or edit template requires a
ondrop="return calli.insertResource(event)" as shown here:
