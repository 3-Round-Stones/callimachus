Callimachus Project Release Notes

5 June 2012

= REQUIREMENTS OF 0.17 =

Callimachus works best on browsers that are closely tracking the
development of HTML5.  At the time of this writing, Callimachus
works best on Chrome, with Firefox and Safari as second choices.  It is
recommended that Callimachus users track updates to their browsers for
the best usage experience.

Chrome 17 has been thoroughly tested.
Firefox 10 and Safari 5 have no known issues.
Internet Explorer 8 and 9 can login and read content, use the
edit form, but cannot edit text documents or create complex resources.

The Callimachus server requires Java JDK 1.6.0_18+ (before 1.7) on the
server to run.

= NEW IN VERSION 0.17 =

Named queries in Callimachus may now include parameters to facilitate their
reuse.  For example, a simple SPARQL SELECT query may now be created once
and used with different parameters, like this:
[[
SELECT * { <$param> ?p ?o }
]]

Named queries can also now specify their max cache age. Include a comment in the
query string of "# @Cache-Control: max-age=600" to cache query results for 10
minutes. Most Response Cache-Control Directives can be used here to control how
query results should be cached.

= KNOWN ISSUES IN 0.17 =

 * Empty table cells are omitted in from template.
 * All possible options in check boxes must have a label.
 * Trailing whitespace in @typeof attribute is not supported.
 * rdf:XMLLiteral on form create auto adds xmlns to elements.
 * When resource labels are updated, referencing resource may not display new
   label until they are modified as well or the callimachus-reset script is run.
 * Safari browser cannot view Turtle or RDF/XML output in describe tab.
 * Safari does not retain the login state in all cases.

In some environments, Callimachus may log "An exception has occurred in the
compiler...FilePermission" exceptions. This is often due to an issue in the
embedded Java compiler and if so has no impact on the run time behaviour of
Callimachus.

= HOWTO UPGRADE FROM 0.16 =

All information saved through a Web browser is saved in the repositories
directory. This directory should be backed up (in the stopped state) before
attempting to upgrade.

Stop the 0.16 server using the callimachus-stop script in the bin directory.
Remove the lib, bin, tmp, src directories.

Download and unzip the callimachus-0.17.zip file in the install directory of
the Callimachus 0.16 instance. Run the bin/callimachus-setup.sh/.bat script to
upgrade the repositories directory. Run the bin/callimachus-start.sh/.bat script
to start Callimachus.
