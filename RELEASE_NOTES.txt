Callimachus Project Release Notes

---------------------------
| CHANGES IN VERSION 0.13 |
---------------------------

Callimachus 0.13 supports the HTML5 File API for the drag-and-drop of
files into Callimachus Folders.  The file API is implemented in current
versions of Firefox and Chrome, but not implemented in Safari 5, IE 9
or Opera 10.

Upload of files causes lower-casing of file names.  The side effect is
that imported applications will need to refer to their files
using lower-case names, regardless of the case in the uploaded files.
File URLs include file extensions, although file extensions are not
shown in the Folder view.

Files may be deleted by selecting the file, and then selecting the Edit
tab.  Selecting the 'Delete' button in the Edit tab will delete a file.
