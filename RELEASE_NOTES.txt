Callimachus Project Release Notes

http://callimachusproject.org/

6 December 2011

= REQUIREMENTS OF 0.14 =

Callimachus works best on browsers that are closely tracking the
development of HTML5.  At the time of this writing, Callimachus
works best on Chrome, with Firefox and Safari as second choices.  It is
recommended that Callimachus users track updates to their browsers for
the best usage experience.

Chrome 14 has been thoroughly tested.
Firefox 7 and Safari 5 have no known issues.
Internet Explorer 8 can perform most tasks.

Internet Explorer 7 and 9 can login and read content, but do not work with
editing operations, including forms.

Callimachus requires Java 6 (server-side) to run.

= NEW IN VERSION 0.14 =

Callimachus 0.14 can export and import folder contents through the edit tab of a folder.

= KNOWN ISSUES IN 0.14 =

Blank nodes are not supported. It may be necessary to skolemize blank
nodes in create and edit forms. See the directory.car sample app for an example
of this.

= HOWTO UPGRADE FROM 0.13 =

All information saved through a Web browser is saved in the repositories
directory. This directory should be backup (in the stopped state) before
attempting to upgrade.

Stop the 0.13 server using the callimachus-stop script in the bin directory.
Remove the lib and tmp directories. Remove the supplied callimachus.war file in
the webapps directory.
Backup any configuration files in etc, including etc/callimachus.conf. Unzip
callimachus-0.14.zip over top of the rest of your existing installation. This
will restore a lib directory and webapps/callimachus.war. Restore your
configuration settings in etc/callimachus.conf. Start the server using the new
callimachus start script in the bin directory with the argument "--update".

$ callimachus-start.bat --update
-- OR --
$ sh callimachus-start.sh --update

All edit and create templates with dropzones should include the attribute
ondrop="calli.insertResource(event)".

All client side javascript calli functions now take the HTML event object
as the first parameter. Replace this or form parameter with the event object.
